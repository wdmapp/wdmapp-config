Applying for Access
*******************************************************************

Overview
============

The Whole Device Model Application (WDMApp) uses access controlled versions of
XGC, GENE, GEM and supporting tools.  Before installing these packages users must
first apply for access.  Specific instructions for each package, and WDMApp are
given below.

XGC
===========================
Visit https://xgc.pppl.gov/html/getting_xgc.html for instructions.  Be sure to
reference the WDMApp ECP project and list `XGC-Develop` as the needed software.

GENE
==================
Visit http://genecode.org/ then click the 'Get GENE' link at the top and fill
out the form.

GEM
==================
Visit http://www.gemgyrokinetic.org/, click the 'Download File' link at the bottom
and follow the instructions within the form.


WDMAPP
==================
Once you have submitted applications to the above, and access has been granted, please send
your GitHub and GENE GitLab usernames to `kai dot germaschewski at unh dot edu` and
`smithc11 at rpi dot edu` so we can verify your access to XGC, GENE, and GEM and give you membership to the 
WDMApp GitHub Organization.
